##### Funny story :joy:

One day I was looking for a tissue(handkerchief) in my job.  everyone spoke french. I was trying to practice it. 
I mispronounced the word mouchoir(tissue) with m√¢choire(Jaw). people confused and  I surprised they didn't understand it.
But at the end of the day one guy corrected me and I shocked when he told me that I was asking if someone has a jaw, instead of handkerchief.
